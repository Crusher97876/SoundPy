# SoundPy
## What is soundpy?
SoundPy it's a soundboard application coded entirely with python3. After the first install you already have a set of default sounds chosen by the most popular sounds of the moment (updated to 17/8/23). 
In addition, in this first version you can also add your own sounds and play it, so that anyone will have a unique version of the application and a fully customizable use experience.

## Problems and Advices
Since i'm new to the world of open repositories here on github it will be very helpful to me if you can share in the issues tab all the problems and bugs encountered while using the app. At the moment there are no bugs discovered but don't be afraid to help me to give you the best product possible.
I would also like to receive feedbacks on usage as well as suggestions and advices to be implemented for future versions of the application.

## Installation process
You can see the source code here on github and you can download the installer for your device (see the setups folder). At the moment the only installer I've created is for Windows os, but in the future I'll try to create it for Linux and MacOS as well.
