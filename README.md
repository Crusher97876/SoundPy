# SoundPy
## What is soundpy?
SoundPy it's a soundboard application coded entirely with python3. After the first install you already have a set o default sounds chosen by the most popular sounds of the moment (17/8/23). In addition, in this first version you can also add your own sounds and play it. In this way anyone will have a unique version of the application.
